# Ethereum Bridge
The Incognito side-chain can be attached to any blockchain to conduct confidential asset transfer — this time, we consider Ethereum. The Incognito network runs parallel to main blockchains, allowing for secure two-way transfers of crypto assets whenever privacy is needed.
Incognito has implemented an Incognito-Ethereum bridge — designed for fully decentralized cross-chain interoperability. Implementations will enable cross-chain communication between the two blockchains, and enable the choice of “incognito mode” for transfers of crypto assets (ETH and ERC20 tokens). Using this bridge, anyone can turn on privacy for their tokens and shield their balances and activity.
